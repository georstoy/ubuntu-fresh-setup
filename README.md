# Freshly installed Ubuntu Desktop setup

A very simple script to install the usual stuff! At least my usual one :-) 

## Quick start 

Just run the shell script

    ./setup.sh
    
## Customizing

If you want to customize the setup, e.g. installing different package versions, copy the script, edit and run. There are various variables defined at the top of the file. Read the comments and apply changes as you wish.
